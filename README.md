# Welcome to Croppr app ðŸ‘‹

Warning: Only works for android, not developed for ios because of there was no ios device i had to test on it including mac and iphone

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install --force
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npm run android
   ```

3. Select Android from CLI (press a) (better to use a real device because it has access to files in device.)   

   - Make sure that you have followed this guide before using app: 
   [Local build](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?mode=development-build&buildEnv=local)
   - At this step: https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?mode=development-build&buildEnv=local#running-your-app-on-an-android-device, skip the `Install expo-dev-client` step because its already done.

4. (Optional) Try same app on different devices and OS s and make sure that app is working properly.
